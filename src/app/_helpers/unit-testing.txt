so initiall we first load the component and create the instance of it
whenever we create the new component , it basically does the above thing

testbed is the primary upi for writing unit tests in angular
testbed.configureTestingModule()
componenttexture helps us in debugging the testcase and in run time detectChanges
we can automatically detect the changes using fixture

basically the concept of testing,suppose i have a property in ts file,and you want to check if that property is having the value you have given or not

usage:
it("testing title here",<arrow function here> ()=>
{
    then expecting the component.componentname tobe(user)
    so if it doesnt satisfy it ,this should fail
})

use ngtest() for testing now compiles how many test cases and where they are written

so when its different, this will fail and it shows the description of the issue

got 5 errors in my unit testing: one of them
NullInjectorError: R3InjectorError(DynamicTestModule)[FormBuilder -> FormBuilder]: 

how i resolved:
FormBuilder is defined in the FormsModule. You will notice that it is imported in AppModule (which is why your app compiles and runs) but it is not imported in configureTestingModule in app.component.spec.ts.
